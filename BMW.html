        <h2>Let's take a closer look at Rolls-Royce</h2>
        <p>Here are the luxuary models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phantom</li>
            <li>Phantom EWB</li>
            <li>Wraith</li>
            <li>Ghost</li>
            <li>Dawn</li>
            <li>Black Badge</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some brief characteristics of the most popular model-Phantom:</h3>
        <p>Prodigious power is provided by a 563-hp twin-turbo V-12 paired with an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk, but Rolls-Royce's claimed 5.1-second zero-to-60-mph time isn't anything you'd appreciate your chauffer trying to replicate; the Phantom is better suited for wafting along with smooth, steady inputs to throttle and steering. To say that the ride is smooth would be an understatement: The Phantom practically levitates over the road and features a pothole-spotting camera that helps the suspension adapt to road imperfections in real time. </p>
