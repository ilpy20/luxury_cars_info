<h1>FERRARI</h1>
<p>Ferrari (/fəˈrɑːri/; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940. However, the company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in 1947, when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed.

  In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance.[3] In June 2018, the 1964 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million.

  In Ferrari's first official announcement of the car,
  the 458 was described as the successor to the F430 but arising from an entirely new design,
  incorporating technologies developed from the company's experience in Formula One.[8]
  The body computer system was developed by Magneti Marelli.</p>
<p>
  The 458 is powered by a 4,497 cc (4.5 L; 274.4 cu in) engine of the "Ferrari/Maserati" F136 V8 family,
  generating a power output of 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) at 9,000 rpm (redline) and 540 N⋅m (398 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,000 rpm[9] with 80% torque available at 3,250 rpm.
  [8] The engine features direct fuel injection, which is a first for Ferrari mid-engine setups in its road cars.
  The only transmission available on the 458 is a dual-clutch 7-speed Getrag gearbox,
  in a different state of tune shared with the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.[8] There is no traditional manual option, making this the fourth road-car after the Enzo, Challenge Stradale and 430 Scuderia not to be offered with Ferrari's classic gated manual. It is the first mainstream model to not be offered with a manual transmission.
  In keeping with Ferrari tradition, the body was designed by Pininfarina under the leadership of Donato Coco, the Ferrari design director.

  The interior design of the Ferrari 458 Italia was done by Bertrand Rapatel (Director of Ferrari Interior Design), a French automobile designer.
  The car's exterior styling and features were designed for aerodynamic efficiency, producing a downforce of 140 kg (309 lb) at 200 km/h (120 mph).
  [8] In particular, the front grille features deformable winglets that lower at high speeds, in order to offer reduced drag.[15]
  The car's interior was designed using input from former Ferrari Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher; in a layout common to racing cars,
  the new steering wheel incorporates many controls normally located on the dashboard or on stalks, such as turning signals or high beams.[8]
  According to British car magazine Autocar, the 458 Italia's design has drawn inspiration from the Enzo Ferrari and its Millechili concept car.[16] It has been designed to be Ferrari's sportiest V8-engined car, to distinguish itself from the entry level Ferrari California.
